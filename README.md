> Observability and Interceptability, Objects and Arrays.

# Observer

Observer is a simple set of functions for intercepting and observing JavaScript objects and arrays. It is designed for general-purpose event-based architectures (from UI data-binding to debugging, and everything in between). It draws its inspiration from [Object.observe](https://arv.github.io/ecmascript-object-observe) and JavaScript's other reflection APIs like [`Reflect`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Reflect), and features better object interceptability than what's possible with property [setters](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Functions/set) and [getters](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Functions/get).
