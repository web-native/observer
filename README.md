# Reflex
> A general-purpose reflection API for observing objects and arrays in JavaScript.

The Reflex API is a simple set of functions for detecting and responding to changes made to any JavaScript object or array. It draws its inspiration from biological [reflex actions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reflex) and JavaScriptâ€™s set of reflection APIs like `Object.observe()` and `Reflect.set()`. Say Hi to general-purpose "reactivity"; bye to "Observables" and other object wrappers!.
