# Reflex
The Reflex API is a simple set of functions for detecting and responding to changes made to any JavaScript object or array. It draws its inspiration from biological [reflex actions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reflex) and JavaScriptâ€™s set of reflection APIs like `Object.observe()` and `Reflect.set()`. To put it best, Reflex is a reflection API that is supercharged with reactivity in the form of reflex actions.
